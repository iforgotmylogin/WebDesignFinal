        <p><br>There I was, looking like a heavily-armed garden gnome, ready to take on the great outdoors with a crew of wannabe Darwins. Our guide, Grizzly Adams' less intelligent cousin, assured us this would be a hunting trip more memorable than a sasquatch sighting at a vegan potluck. Boy, was he right.</br>

            <br>Let me introduce our ragtag group. There was Bob, who nearly blew his own foot off after mistaking it for a 10-point buck. Then we had Hank, a man who conversed in grunts and smelled like a hiking trail's bathroom. But the real star was me, Dan "Buck Snort" Defrance, an asphalt-bred citiot who thought camo was the latest hipster fashion trend.</br>
            
            <br>We thrashed through the brush like drunken wildebeests, stumbling over every root and rock Nature could thrown our way. One chipmunk actually stopped to shake its furry head at our circus act before scampering off to die of secondhand embarrassment. Watching us try to start a campfire was like viewing a Neanderthal invent the gasoline engine. Somehow I managed to transform my head into a sticky, gooey s'mores remnant that every bug wanted to be Best Auxilliaries with. We may not have gotten our buck, but we earned the badge of "Klutziest Campout Katastrophe.""</br><br>10/10 hunting trip experinece. Would go again!</p>
