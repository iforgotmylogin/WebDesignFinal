            <br>There I was, looking like a heavily-armed garden gnome, ready to take on the great outdoors with a crew of wannabe Darwins. Our guide, Grizzly Adams' less intelligent cousin, assured us this would be a hunting trip more memorable than a sasquatch sighting at a vegan potluck. Boy, was he right.</br>
            <br>Let me introduce our ragtag group. There was Bob, who nearly blew his own foot off after mistaking it for a 10-point buck. Then we had Hank, a man who conversed in grunts and smelled like a hiking trail's bathroom. But the real star was me, Dan "Buck Snort" Defrance, an asphalt-bred citiot who thought camo was the latest hipster fashion trend.</br>
            <br>We thrashed through the brush like drunken wildebeests, stumbling over every root and rock Nature could thrown our way. One chipmunk actually stopped to shake its furry head at our circus act before scampering off to die of secondhand embarrassment. Watching us try to start a campfire was like viewing a Neanderthal invent the gasoline engine. Somehow I managed to transform my head into a sticky, gooey s'mores remnant that every bug wanted to be Best Auxilliaries with. We may not have gotten our buck, but we earned the badge of 'Klutziest Campout Katastrophe.'</br>
            <br>10/10 hunting trip experinece. Would go again!

            <br>My recent fishing trip was quite the adventure, albeit not exactly what I anticipated. My Captain, who we'll call "Captain Crunch" at the helm, we set off on the good ship "Misadventure" with high hopes and a bucketful of bait. As we sailed into the great unknown, I couldn't shake the feeling that this outing would be more "three-ring circus" than "fisherman's paradise."</br>
            <br>Captain Crunch assured us he had the inside scoop on the best fishing spot in the area, though it seemed more like a well-kept secret from the fish themselves. Undeterred, I cast my line into the water, hoping for a catch so big it would need its own zip code. But it seemed the fish were on their lunch break, leaving us to entertain ourselves with tales of the ones that got away and the occasional seagull squabble over a stolen sandwich.</br>
            <br>Just when I was starting to think our expedition was destined for the blooper reel, I felt a tug on my line that nearly yanked me off my feet. With visions of fish feasts dancing in my head, I reeled in... a glob of seaweed. It seems even the seven seas have a sense of humor.</br>
            <br>Amidst our bemeused laughter and exasperated groans, my mighty catch had somehow gotten itself tangled up in Captain Crunch's hat. As he lifted the hat, expecting a prize-worthy fish, we were greeted instead by a comical sight of seaweed dangling from the brim. He bestowed this hat upon me, which, though it is an icon of my shame and ineptitude, I wear it proudly to this day.</br>
